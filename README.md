## PROFESSIONAL EXECUTION

### Founding Solutions Architect | AI Systems & Performance Engineering
*Dec 2024 – Present*

* **Agentic Systems Orchestration:** Architected a recursive R&D workflow utilizing multi-agent reasoning models to discover and implement system-level optimizations; accelerated the delivery of complex Rust/CUDA modules by ~40% through automated architectural discovery.
* **VideoForge (Rust/Tauri):** Architected a deterministic AI upscaling engine with a custom shared-memory ring buffer; utilized atomic state management to achieve zero-copy IPC between Rust and Python, eliminating serialization overhead and reducing frame latency by ~60%.
* **OmniBabel (Speech-to-Speech):** Architected a real-time AI translation engine that converts system-level audio into natural voice output in <100ms. Leveraged transparent overlays and system audio loopback to enable seamless, cross-lingual communication for high-stakes B2B environments.
* **Model Optimization Lab:** Benchmarked and deployed 20+ local architectures (including Gemma-3 12B and Qwen3-VL); utilized extreme quantization (IQ1_M to Q8_0) to achieve high-fidelity inference on consumer-grade hardware.
* **DNA-AI (Privacy-First):** Architected a local-only genetic analyzer using Llama 3 to process complex ClinVar datasets with 100% data sovereignty and zero cloud dependency.

### Technical Sales Engineer (Solutions Focus) | Cellular Sales
*Feb 2024 – Feb 2025*

* **Revenue Optimization:** Consistently achieved 125% of monthly sales quota by translating complex hardware and network specifications into high-value B2B propositions.
* **Strategic Discovery:** Led deep-dive technical sessions to identify infrastructure pain points and scope tailored hardware/SaaS solutions for enterprise clients.
* **Stakeholder Alignment:** Acted as the primary technical resource during the sales cycle, resolving conflicting stakeholder goals to ensure long-term client retention and satisfaction.

### STEM Educator & SPED Case Manager | Lucia Mar Unified School District
*July 2021 – June 2023*

* **Cross-Functional Leadership:** Facilitated high-stakes IEP meetings between medical specialists, administrators, and families; resolved complex stakeholder conflicts to meet 100% of state compliance metrics.
* **Data-Driven Analysis:** Developed adaptive instructional frameworks based on real-time performance analytics to accommodate diverse neurodivergent learning profiles.

### Web Developer / Technical Liaison | University of California, San Diego
*Mar 2016 – Jan 2017*

* **Infrastructure Management:** Managed university web properties using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring 99.9% uptime and strict accessibility (WCAG) compliance.
* **Technical Translation:** Served as the bridge between engineering teams and non-technical departments to translate organizational requirements into functional digital assets.
